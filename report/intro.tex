\section{Introduction}
During this summer, I undertook an internship to complete some tasks set by the OpenDreamKit project. The focus of the internship was the Maths-in-the-Middle paradigm (MitM)- an idea of establishing a universal communication system between different computer algebra systems (CAS) that would allow researchers to exploit their best features while solving complex problems. The tasks were:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define group theory, as it is defined and implemented in the GAP computer algebra system, in the MMT language so that it can later be used for automation of alignment between a GAP SCSCP server and the MitM server.
    \item Create an MitM proof-of-concept study that would showcase a problem being solved using miltiple CAS queried through an MitM server without the user having any knowledge of the underlying systems.
\end{enumerate}
