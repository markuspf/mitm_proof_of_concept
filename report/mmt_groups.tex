\section{Definition of GAP Type System in MMT}
In order to ensure smooth interaction between different algebra systems, the MMT server must have access to formalized concepts represented by them. The first step was thus to formalize the concepts of group theory available in the GAP system in the MMT language. The resulting code can be seen in MitM/groups repository on Mathhub\cite{mitm_groups}.
